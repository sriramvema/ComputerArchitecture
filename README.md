# ComputerArchitecture
Simulates a MIPS assembly system using registers and memory to complete functions such as ADDU, ADDIU, SUBU, SW, LW, AND, OR, and others.

For this project, I used C++. To compile it, I have included a Makefile in my project submission. Type make into the terminal and the code 
will be compiled. ./proj will run the project. On line 360, I have added the connection to the Instruction file. You can modify that to test other files 
for instructions. The load function also connects to IMemory.txt, automatically loading the memory from the file.
